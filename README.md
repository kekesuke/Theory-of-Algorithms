# Theory-of-Algorithms
## What is this repository for ?
### (Post-Correspondence problem & Countdown Numbers Game using Python Libraries)

###### This repository contains an overview of what I have done for the module that I am currently studying. The module is called Theory-of-Algorithms. The repository provides some insights of my work on [`Post-Correspondence Problem`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem) and `Countdown Game` which is a British game show. There is a  concise overview of the Post-Correspondence Problem. Inside this repository you are going to find a few `Jupyter notebooks`, the main ones being: Post-Correspondence and Countdown which I created and worked on.

- Few of the tools I used for the Post-Correspondence jupyter notebook are : [`itertools`](https://realpython.com/python-itertools/), [`Sets`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets) and [`Tuples`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) . They are the useful Libraries provided by Python in order to show an example of what post-correspondence is and to write a program for bounded PCP.

- The second notebook `Countdown` contains an overview of what Countdown Numbers game is how complex it, and Python function to solve the countdown game.

### This project has two [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
1. [Post-Correspondence Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem)
2. [Countdown Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show))

## The few methods to run those notebooks are:

#### Using Jupyter lab
1. Copy git repository URL.
2. Create blank folder.
3. Open cmder pointing to that blank folder URL.
4. Type "git clone (URL here)".
5. Type cd 'Theory-of-Algorithms' into cmder
6. Type "jupyter lab" into cmder.
Click into post-correspondence.ipynb or countdown.ipynb and click on the two arrows "Restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook" - model should run all cells after a few minutes.

#### Using Docker
1. Copy git repository URL.
2. Create blank folder.
3. Open cmder pointing to that blank folder URL.
4. Type "git clone (URL here)".
5. Type cd 'Theory-of-Algorithms' into cmder
5. Type "docker-compose up" into cmder.
6. Wait till image is build.
6. Copy the url from cmder that docker has created into your browser.
Click into post-correspondence.ipynb or countdown.ipynb and click on the two arrows "Restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook" - model should run all cells after a few minutes.

#### Using nbviewer
