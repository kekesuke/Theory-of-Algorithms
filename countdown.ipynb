    "### What is a Countdown Numbers game?\n",
    "Countdown Numbers game is a British TV game show. One of its rounds is called the Numbers round where the contestants choose 6 number cards out of the possible 24. The numbers are arranged in two categories: 20 small numbers ( two sets of 1 to 10) and 4 large numbers (25,50,75,100). After choosing, a random 3-digit number is generated, and the contestants have to work out a calculation that results in that number or as close to it as possible by using the previously selected numbers.  However, there are a few rules that have to be followed: <br>\n",
    "•    Each of the 6 selected numbers can be used once <br>\n",
    "•    Only the four basic operations can be used – \n",
    "addition, subtraction, multiplication and division <br>\n",
    "Additionally,  not all 6 numbers have to be used. <br>\n",
